# Buckaroo Wishlist âœ¨

Meta repo for Buckaroo package requests. 

## Requesting a Package

 1. First check that the package is not already available. The full list of packages can be found at [buckaroo-pm](https://github.com/buckaroo-pm). 
 
 2. Check that there is not an existing issue for the package. If there is already an issue, leave a comment! This will draw our attention :wink:
 
 3. Create an issue on this repo. Ideally, the title should be `author/package`. Please include a link to the source-code, the version you are interested in using, the platform you are on and any quirks you think we might encounter. 
 
 4. We will work with you to port the package. Our current turn-around is approximately 1 working day but some packages may be trickier than others!
